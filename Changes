AutoSplit now writes #line directives into the split files.

Repackaging of an otherwise (nearly) unaltered package. I had wrong
timestamps in the year 2020 which caused some make()s to bail out.
I took the opportunity to change the intro a little.

Changed the whole concept to have the internal function autosplit_file
actually act on *files*, not on modules, thus allowing for several
packages within a file. Inspired by comments that had been written in
the original file by Tim (I suppose). Several messages from AutoSplit
have changed to reflect the new concept.

Made use strict clean.

Added $VERSION

Renamed several internal variables that had non-intuitive names.

Made it a distribution with a testfile.

Fixed bug: too long subroutine names lost prototype. (Very minor bug)

Slightly improved the documentation.
