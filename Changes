Changed the whole concept to have the internal function autosplit_file
actually act on *files*, not on modules, thus allowing for several
packages within a file. Inspired by comments that had been written in
the original file by Tim (I suppose). Several messages from AutoSplit
have changed to reflect the new concept.

Made use strict clean.

Added $VERSION

Renamed several internal variables that had non-intuitive names.

Made it a distribution with a testfile.

Fixed bug: too long subroutine names lost prototype. (Very minor bug)

Slightly improved the documentation.
